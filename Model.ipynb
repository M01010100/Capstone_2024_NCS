    "# Results\n",
    "* Non-encrpted Accuracy is 0.7277\n",
    "* Encrypted Accurracy is 0.7366\n",
    "* In this situation the encrypted model did better then the non-encrypted version.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Size\n",
    "* Extreme size difference, 14,336 bytes to 392586908 bytes for X_train, although it was done through the use of serializing as nbytes does not work with CKKS.vecors\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time\n",
    "* The Non-encrypted model took less then a second per epoch with the cell needing 0.1 seconds to compute.\n",
    "* Data Encryption took 20 seconds to complete\n",
    "* The Encrypted Model took an average just under 1 minute per epoch (58 seconds), and 4 minutes and 53 seconds to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resources\n",
    "* Non-encrypted model used 183.01 MB of memory\n",
    "* Encryption used 2 Gigabytes of Memory to complete\n",
    "* The Encrypted model used 2 Gigabytes of memory aswell.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remarks\n",
    "* 27,000 times more bytes neeeded from 14 KilaBytes to 329 MegaBytes. \n",
    "* 2930 time longer to run from 0.1 seconds to 4 minutes and 53 seconds\n",
    "* While I Plan to continue studying in this field it is good to note, that as of now there is better version being worked on and developed. SEAL has been unoffically killed by microsoft as their is no longer a team working on the library, which also means TenSEAL is defunct as well. This model was inspired by one using TenSEAL "
